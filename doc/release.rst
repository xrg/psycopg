How to make a psycopg2 release
==============================

- Edit ``setup.py`` and set a stable version release. Use PEP 440 to choose
  version numbers, e.g.

  - ``2.7``: a new major release, new features
  - ``2.7.1``: a bugfix release
  - ``2.7.1.1``: a release to fix packaging problems
  - ``2.7.2.dev0``: version held during development, non-public test packages...
  - ``2.8b1``: a beta for public tests

  In the rest of this document we assume you have exported the version number
  into an environment variable, e.g.::

    $ export VERSION=2.7

- In the `Travis settings`__ you may want to be sure that the variables
  ``TEST_PAST`` and ``TEST_FUTURE`` are set to a nonzero string to check all
  the supported postgres version.

.. __: https://travis-ci.org/psycopg/psycopg2/settings

- Push psycopg2 to master or to the maint branch. Make sure tests on Travis__
  and AppVeyor__ pass.

.. __: https://travis-ci.org/psycopg/psycopg2
.. __: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/psycopg/psycopg2

- For an extra test merge or rebase the `test_i686`__ branch on the commit to
  release and push it too: this will test with Python 32 bits and debug
  versions.

.. __: https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/tree/test_i686

- Create a signed tag with the content of the relevant NEWS bit and push it.
  E.g.::

    $ git tag -a -s 2_7 

    Psycopg 2.7 released

    What's new in psycopg 2.7
    -------------------------

    New features:

    - Added `~psycopg2.sql` module to generate SQL dynamically (:ticket:`#308`).
    ...

- Update the `psycopg2-wheels`_ submodule to the tag version and push. This
  will build the packages on `Travis CI`__ and `AppVeyor`__ and upload them to
  the `initd.org upload`__ dir.

.. _psycopg2-wheels: https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2-wheels
.. __: https://travis-ci.org/psycopg/psycopg2-wheels
.. __: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/psycopg/psycopg2-wheels
.. __: http://initd.org/psycopg/upload/

- Download the packages generated (this assumes ssh configured properly)::

    $ rsync -arv initd-upload:psycopg2-${VERSION} .

- Sign the packages and upload the signatures back::

    $ for f in psycopg2-${VERSION}/*.{exe,tar.gz,whl}; do \
        gpg --armor --detach-sign $f;
      done

    $ rsync -arv psycopg2-${VERSION} initd-upload:

- Run the ``copy-tarball.sh`` script on the server to copy the uploaded files
  in the `tarballs`__ dir::

    $ ssh psycoweb@initd.org copy-tarball.sh ${VERSION}

.. __: http://initd.org/psycopg/tarballs/

- Remove the ``.exe`` from the dir, because we don't want to upload them on
  PyPI::

    $ rm -v psycopg2-${VERSION}/*.exe{,.asc}

- Only for stable packages: upload the packages and signatures on PyPI::

    $ twine upload psycopg2-${VERSION}/*

- Create a release and release notes in the psycopg website, announce to
  psycopg and pgsql-announce mailing lists.

- Edit ``setup.py`` changing the version again (e.g. go to ``2.7.1.dev0``).


Releasing test packages
-----------------------

Test packages may be uploaded on the `PyPI testing site`__ using::

    $ twine upload -r testpypi psycopg2-${VERSION}/*

assuming `proper configuration`__ of ``~/.pypirc``.
